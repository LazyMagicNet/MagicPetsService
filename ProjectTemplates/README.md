# Project Templates
This folder contains templates that LazyMagic uses to create/update projects. 

You may modify these templates to suit your needs. LazyMagic will not overwrite these files when creating new projects. We suggest you copy the template you want to modify, give it a new name, and modify the copy so updating to new project templates provided by LazyMagic will be easier. Your modified templates can be placed in a different folder.

## LazyMagic Directives
LazyMagic directives, in the LazyMagic.yaml file, are used to control the generation of projects. The directive allows yo to specify the tempate to use. Note that LazyMagic generation relies on the template files having the types and core content provided in the ProjectTemplates folder.

#### Example:
Defaults:
```
  SchemaDefaults:
	Type: SchemaDefaults
    Properties:
      DotNetSchemaProject:
        Template: ./ProjectTemplates/Schema
        OutputFolder: Schemas
      DotNetRepoProject:
        Template: ./ProjectTemplates/Repo
        OutputFolder: Repos
```

Specific Schema using the SchemaDefaults.
```
  NotificationsSchema:
	Type: Schema
	Properties:
	  Defaults: SchemaDefaults
	  OpenApiSpecs:
	  - openapi.notifications-schema.yaml
```

- Referenced by Module.DotNetProject.Template.

### Lambda

- Referenced by WebApi.DotNetProject.Template


## Default Namespaces
Each template uses a default namespace. This means you should not add a namespace to the project or any of its cs files.

The templates do not contain a ```<RootNameSapce>``` definition. This means the csproj name (without the .csproj extension) will be used as the root namespace in the generated project. 

Use the LazyMagic PropertyGroup attribute, for the DotNetProject, to specify your own root namespace.

Generated Projects are named using the directive name. For example:
```
  NotificationsSchema:
    Type: Schema
    Properties:
      Defaults: SchemaDefaults
      OpenApiSpecs:
      - openapi.notifications-schema.yaml
```
This directive will produce a project named NotificationsSchema.csproj and the root namespace will be the default of NotificationsSchema.


## GlobalUsings.cs 
Each project uses a GlobalUsings.cs file to define global using statements. This file is included in each project and is used to define global using statements. LazyMagic project directives may add additional using statements to this file.

The GlobalUsings.cs file is named GlobalUsings.g.cs in the generated project. 

## General Notes

In general, except for the csproj file in the generated project, files that are generated by LazyMagic have the compound extension .g.cs.

Most classes defined in these templates are partial classes. This allows you to add additional methods and properties to the class in other files that live in the generated project. 

## Warning
Any changes you make to files, in the generated project, with a .g.cs extension will be lost if you regenerate the project.

## Best Practice
Try not to modifiy these tempalte projects. Instead, create a new template project. This will make it easier to update to newer versions of LazyMagic when new versions of the standard templates are released.

Usually, you can just copy the extiing template, give it a meaning name, and modify it to suit your needs.
