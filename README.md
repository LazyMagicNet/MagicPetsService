## Package Management 
We are using the new PackageReference format for NuGet packages. This is the new default for .NET Core 2.0.
We are using CPVM (Central Package Version Management) to manage the versions of packages. This is a new feature of NuGet 4.3.0.
The Directory.Packages.props file contains the package versions. This file is in the solution root directory.
